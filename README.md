Attimo is personal productivity app to store all your personal lists and records of activities in a single, easy to access place. 

# Project mission

In our daily life we are bombarded with useful information: where to go, what to do, what you liked, which movie to watch next... it can get overwhelming to remember all this, and sometimes one wishes they could extend their memory. 

Whether you need to remember some information, or would like to record some task, Attimo provides you with the tools to define a list, a _schema_ and quickly add new information with this structure. 

## Coming soon

- [ ] GUI :: using WAILS with JS as a layer on top of GO
- [ ] Calendar :: jumping back and forth from table and calendar view.

## About:
**Is this just a table editor?**
Not really. Attimo primarily provides support to check the information that you insert, and ways to navigate the tables, but it makes no effort to support advanced mathematical applications.

**How did the project start?**
The project was born as the replacement for [Tommaso Ferracina](https://github.com/tferracina/)'s [clockwork-cli](https://github.com/tferracina/clockwork) and [Tebe Nigrelli](https://github.com/tebe-nigrelli)'s [doom-emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) personal config. 

Studying Mathematics for AI inspired us to experiment with [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/), which ultimately inspired us to start the project.

## Active developers
Attimo is actively developed by [Tommaso Ferracina](https://github.com/tferracina/) and [Tebe Nigrelli](https://github.com/tebe-nigrelli).
